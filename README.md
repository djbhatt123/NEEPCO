# NEEPCO
I have undergone 15 days In-plant training in AgGBPS,
NEEPCO, where I have learnt basics of the gas based Combined Cycle thermal
power plant both theoretically as well as practically. I have learnt about the
working of various type of machines like Turbine (Gas,Steam), Generators,
Boilers, etc and also about Cooling System, Electrical Transmission and
Switchyard.
